🚀 My First Power BI Report – A New Milestone in My BI Journey 🚀

I’m excited to share my first Power BI report, built as part of a hands-on workshop conducted by Datacense, where I’ve started my journey into Business Intelligence and Data Analytics.

This report reflects not just the data behind it, but also the process of learning new tools like Power Query, DAX, and data visualization – essential pillars of Power BI. It was an amazing experience to clean, transform, and visualize data in a meaningful and interactive way.

💡 Key Skills Used:

Data Cleaning & Shaping in Power Query Editor

Designing Interactive Dashboards

Writing Basic to Intermediate DAX Measures

Creating Visuals for Data-Driven Insights

📊 What I’ve Learned:
Power BI isn’t just a tool – it’s a way of thinking. Understanding data, shaping it for purpose, and making it speak visually has changed how I view problems and solutions in business.

🙏 A big thank you to Mr. Akhilesh Meena for guiding and mentoring us throughout the workshop. Your clear teaching style and industry insights made the concepts easy to understand and apply practically.

🔗 I’ll be uploading the .pbix file along with this post – feel free to check it out and share your feedback. I'm open to suggestions, improvements, or even collaborations.

📍 This is just the beginning. I’m looking forward to diving deeper into advanced reporting, DAX, and connecting real-world business problems to data-driven solutions.
